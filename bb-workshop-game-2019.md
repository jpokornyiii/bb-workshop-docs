# 2019 Bloomberg + FIRST Workshop :: The Game

## Overview
In this game, alliances of two robots will compete in a game similar to dodgeball, and aim to score as many points as possible. The winner of each match is the alliance that has accrued the most points.

## Game Details and Rules
This section provides information about the game, match play and general rules.

### The Arena
The game is played on a section of carpeted floor, measuring 4' by 8'. Dividing the field lengthwise is the CENTERLINE. 2 additional lines, 1' away from the CENTERLINE, indicate the NEUTRAL ZONE. Several ENERGY BALLs are placed along the CENTERLINE.

Towards either end of the field, a line 1' from each end demarcates the HOMEBASE. On either end of the field are 5 DROPTARGETs, which are placed on the end lines.

### Gameplay
All ROBOTs start anywhere in their HOMEBASE. At least 75% of the robot needs to be contained within the HOMEBASE.

An AUTONOMOUS period lasting 15 seconds begins the match. During this period, ROBOTs must move without human input. ALLIANCEs that score points against either ROBOTs or DROPTARGETs score double during the autonomous period. Additionally, points are given for ROBOTs that reach the NEUTRAL ZONE without going over.

Following AUTONOMOUS, a TELEOP mode of 2 minutes and 15 seconds occurs. Here, drivers can take control of their ROBOTs. ROBOTs that end the match in their HOMEBASE get additional points.

ROBOTs in HOMEBASE are considered "safe" and will not generate points for the opposing ALLIANCE if hit by an ENERGY BALL. A ROBOT is defined to be in HOMEBASE if more than 75% of it is contained in the area boudned by the HOMEBASE line and the end of the field.

### Scoring
A ROBOT that is hit by an ENERGY BALL (i.e. the ENERGY BALL must be in motion before contacting the ROBOT) scores 1 point for the opposing ALLIANCE (2 points in AUTONOMOUS). For example, if a blue ROBOT is moving on the field and is hit by a moving ENERGY BALL (regardless of who launched the ball), then the red alliance scores a point.

A DROPTARGET that falls down scores 3 points for the opposing ALLIANCE (6 points in AUTONOMOUS). All DROPTARGETs are scored at the end of the match.

At the end of the match, any ROBOT in their HOMEBASE gets 3 points.

#### Penalties
All penalties will be scored as points for the opposing ALLIANCE.

- Any ROBOT that crosses the far NEUTRAL ZONE line will be assessed a **3 point penalty**.
- Any ROBOT that leaves the field of play for an extended period will be assessed a **3 point penalty**.
